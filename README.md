# Employee Performance & Salary Analysis (Python + SQLite)

This is a simple Python project where I created a small SQLite database to store employee information and performed some basic analysis.

The purpose of this project is to practice working with databases using Python, and to learn how to load data, run queries, and do some simple analysis like salary and performance review.

##  What this project includes:

- Creating an SQLite database named `employee_analysis.db`
- A table called `Employee` with sample data
- Inserting multiple employee records into the table
- Running queries to check and explore the data (like finding average salary, best performers, etc.)
- Preparing the environment to use both Pandas and SQL for data analysis

##  Tools & Libraries Used:

- Python 3.13
- SQLite3
- Pandas
- (Optional) IPython SQL magic commands (just set up, not used here)

##  Learning Outcomes:

- How to create and connect to an SQLite database in Python
- How to insert and fetch data using SQL queries
- How to use Pandas to read SQL tables and perform analysis

##  Project Files:

- `employee_analysis.db`: The SQLite database file
- `employee_analysis.py`: The main Python script with database creation and analysis code

---

##  How to Run:

1. Make sure Python 3.13 is installed.
2. Open the `employee_analysis.py` file in any Python editor (like VS Code or IDLE).
3. Run the script to create the database and perform analysis.
4. The output will show in the terminal or console.

##  Note:

This is a beginner-friendly project made for practice. It shows basic Python and SQL skills that are useful for entry-level data analyst roles.
